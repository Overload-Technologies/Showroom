2. **Shading Models:** A scene with 2 pistols, showcasing the built-in surface shaders of Overload: `Standard`, and `Unlit`
3. **PBR:** Collection of spheres with different PBR metallic and roughness settings.
4. **Materials:** A set of shader balls using different materials to showcase some of the `Standard` shader capabilities.
