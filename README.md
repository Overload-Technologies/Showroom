4. **Materials:** A set of shader balls using different materials to showcase some of the `Standard` shader capabilities.
5. **Reflections:** A scene with a highly reflective helmet to showcase environment reflections using a reflection probe.
6. **Time Of Day:** A dynamically-lit scene with a directional light rotating over time, affecting atmoshperic scattering and overall lighting.
7. **Emissive:** A lightsaber duel to showcase the emissive feature of the standard shader.
8. **Refraction:** Example of materials refracting the environment generated by a reflection probe.
